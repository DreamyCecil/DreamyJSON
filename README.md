# Dreamy JSON

This is a small self-made JSON config parser that's based on YellowAfterlife's interpreter tutorials ( https://yal.cc/interpreters-guide/ ).

Uses Dreamy Structures in its base ( https://github.com/DreamyCecil/DreamyStructures ).

Building
--------

In order to build a project with Dreamy JSON, the source files need to be included into the project and need to have `DreamyJSON.h` file included into source files.
